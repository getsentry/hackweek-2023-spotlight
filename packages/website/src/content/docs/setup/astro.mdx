title: Using Spotlight with Astro
description: A guide how to setup Spotlight for Astro
---

By Adding Spotlight to your Astro application, you can get deep insights into errors and performance issues across your entire stacks.
On this page you'll learn how to install and add Spotlight to your Astro Dev Toolbar with just one command.

## 1. Installation
Start by adding the `@sentry/astro` and `@spotlightjs/astro` dependencies:

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
  ```sh 
  npx astro add @sentry/astro @spotlightjs/astro 
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
  ```sh 
  pnpm astro add @sentry/astro @spotlightjs/astro 
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
  ```sh 
  yarn astro add @sentry/astro @spotlightjs/astro 
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 2. Configuration


The Astro CLI should have already added the Sentry & Spotlight integration to your `astro.config.mjs` file during installation.
It should look similarly to the example below. Otherwise, import and register the Sentry and Spotlight integrations:

```js {3-4, 9}
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';  
                                               
import sentry from "@sentry/astro";           
import spotlightjs from "@spotlightjs/astro"; 
                                               
// https://astro.build/config                 
export default defineConfig({
  // Order matters here!  `sentry()` should come before `spotlightjs()`                 
  integrations: [sentry(), spotlightjs()]     
});
```
:::note[Sentry SDK Version]

If you're already using the `@sentry/astro` SDK in your application, make sure it's on version 7.84.0 or newer.

:::

:::note[Sentry in Production]
If you're using Sentry in production, don't forget to bind the `DSN` and source map configuration:

See [Sentry's documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/astro/) for more information.

## 3. Configure Other Sentry SDKs

If your Astro application is interacting with other services, such as a Python API, you can also configure those SDKs to work with Spotlight. You don't need to be using the Sentry service to take advantage of Sentry's SDKs to power Spotlight.

import { Content as SentryCodeBlock } from '../../../components/sentryCodeBlock.mdx';

<SentryCodeBlock />
