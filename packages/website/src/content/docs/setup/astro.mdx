title: Using Spotlight with Astro
description: A guide how to setup Spotlight for Astro
---

Set up Spotlight in Astro with one command by using Astro's integration system.

Start by adding the `@sentry/astro` and `@spotlightjs/astro` dependencies:

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
  ```sh 
  npx astro add @sentry/astro @spotlightjs/astro 
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
  ```sh 
  pnpm astro add @sentry/astro @spotlightjs/astro 
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
  ```sh 
  yarn astro add @sentry/astro @spotlightjs/astro 
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


After that, Astro should add the Sentry & Spotlight integration to your `astro.config.mjs` file and should look something like this.

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';  
                                               
import sentry from "@sentry/astro";           
import spotlightjs from "@spotlightjs/astro"; 
                                               
// https://astro.build/config                 
export default defineConfig({
  // Order matters here! `spotlightjs()` should come after `sentry()`                 
  integrations: [sentry(), spotlightjs()]     
});
```
:::note[Sentry SDK Version]

If you're already using the `@sentry/astro` SDK in your project, make sure it's on version 7.84.0 or newer.

:::

:::note[Sentry in Production]
If you're using Sentry in production, don't forget to bind the `DSN` and source map configuration:

See [Sentry's documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/astro/) for more information.

## Configure Other Sentry SDKs

If your Astro application is interacting with other services, such as a Python API, you can also configure those SDKs to work with Spotlight. You don't need to be using the Sentry service to take advantage of Sentry's SDKs to power Spotlight.
