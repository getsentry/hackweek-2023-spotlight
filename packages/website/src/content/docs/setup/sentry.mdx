title: Setup Spotlight with Sentry's SDKs
description: Use Spotlight with Sentry
---

Spotlight is built that you don't need Sentry to run it, it can contain any kind of integration. However, Sentry is the first integration we've built for Spotlight and it's a great way to get started.

As mentioned on the previous page, if you want that you Sentry SDKs talk to the Sidecar, enable the `spotlight` setting.
You do not require a `DSN` for this to work.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="JavaScript">
  In the Browser you don't need to set `spotlight: true`, `Spotlight.init()` will automatically detect if Sentry is available and if so, hook into the SDK.
  ```javascript 
    Sentry.init({
      dsn: 'DSN',
    });
    // In the frontend it's important that you init Spotlight after Sentry
    Spotlight.init();
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Node">
  :::caution
  Requires `@sentry/node` version `7.82.0` or higher.
  :::
  ```javascript
    Sentry.init({
        dsn: 'DSN',
        spotlight: true,
    });
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Python">
  :::caution
  Requires `sentry-sdk` version `1.37.0` or higher.
  :::
  ```python 
    sentry_sdk.init(
        dsn="DSN",
        spotlight=True,
    )
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="PHP">
  :::caution
  Requires `sentry/sentry` version `4.1.0` or higher.
  :::
  ```php 
    \Sentry\init([
        'dsn' => 'DSN',
        'spotlight' => true,
    ]);
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Ruby">
  :::caution
  Requires `sentry-ruby` version `5.15.0` or higher.
  :::
  ```ruby 
    Sentry.init do |config|
        config.dsn = 'DSN'
        config.spotlight = true
    end
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


:::note

It's recommended to use the `spotlight` setting only in development.
Please add a check to make sure you only enable it in development.
For example this:

```javascript
  Sentry.init({
    dsn: 'DSN',
    spotlight: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
  });
```

Depending on your setup & language this might be different.
