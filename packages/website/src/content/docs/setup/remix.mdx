## Install Sentry & Spotlight

Follow the [Remix Getting Started](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/remix/) guide on Sentry, and continue from there.

:::note
This guide is focused on Remix _without Vite_. It needs Vite added to the documentation, but the steps should be similar.
:::

<InstallCommand/>

Initialize Spotlight within `entry.client.js`, after you've hydrated the document:

```ts
startTransition(() => {
  hydrateRoot(document, <RemixBrowser />);
});

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
  import("@spotlightjs/spotlight").then((Spotlight) =>
    Spotlight.init({ injectImmediately: true }),
  );
}
```
