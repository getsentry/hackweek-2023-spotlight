import { Content as InstallCommand } from "../../../components/InstallCommand.mdx";
import { LinkCard, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';


## 1. Installation

Follow the [Remix Getting Started](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/remix/) guide on Sentry, and continue from there.

:::note
This guide is focused on Remix _without Vite_. It needs Vite added to the documentation, but the steps should be similar.

<InstallCommand/>


## 2. Configuration

Initialize Spotlight within `sentry.client.js`, after you've hydrated the document:

```ts
startTransition(() => {
  hydrateRoot(document, <RemixBrowser />);
});

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
  import("@spotlightjs/spotlight").then((Spotlight) =>
    Spotlight.init({ injectImmediately: true }),
  );
}
```

## 3. Run the Sidecar

Spotlight's [architecture](/architecture/) requires a sidecar to be running alongside your service. This is to enable streaming data collection from your backend services into the Spotlight overlay.
