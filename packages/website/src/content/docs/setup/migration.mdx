On this page, you'll learn how to update your Spotlight setup to the latest version.

# Migrating from 1.x to 2.x

Version 2.x of Spotlight was introduced to establish compatibility with version 8 of [Sentry's JavaScript SDKs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/).
Some of the breaking v8 SDK changes required changes in how Spotlight interacts with the SDK. 

Affected packages:
- Spotlight Main Package (`@spotlightjs/spotlight`) 
- Spotlight for Astro (`@spotlightjs/astro`) 
- Spotlight Overlay (`@spotlightjs/overlay`)
- Spotlight Electron App* (`@spotlightjs/electron`)

## New minimum Sentry JavaScript SDK versions

Version 2.x of Spotlight is only compatible with versions `>=7.99.0` or `8.x` one of Sentry's JavaScript SDKs like (`@sentry/browser`, `@sentry/react` or `@sentry/nextjs`). 
Older SDK versions are no longer supported in Spotlight 2.x. 

## Changes for non-JavaScript SDK Users

If you're using Spotlight without a Sentry JavaScript SDK, for example for mobile (iOS/Android/ReactNative etc.) or server-side (Python/Ruby/etc.) applications, you update directly to version 2.x without any required changes.

## Other Breaking Changes

None! With the exception of ensuring you have the correct the Sentry JavaScript SDK version, there are no other breaking changes in Spotlight 2.x. 

\* The `@spotlightjs/electron` app was only updated to version 2 because it depends on the `@spotlightjs/overlay` package. There are no breaking changes when using the Electron app!
