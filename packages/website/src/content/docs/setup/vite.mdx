title: Using Spotlight with Vite
description: Use the overlay with Vite
---

If your project is using Vite to build, you can add Spotlight as a plugin and it will automatically
inject itself into the development server. It will also replace the Vite error pages with itself for
more context.

## Configuration

```js {3, 6}
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';
import spotlight from '@spotlightjs/spotlight/vite-plugin';

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [spotlight()],
	test: {
		include: ['src/**/*.{test,spec}.{js,ts}']
	}
});
```
