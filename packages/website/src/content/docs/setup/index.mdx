Spotlight can be used with a variety of frameworks and even in your custom environment. 

While it's not dependent on Sentry, Spotlight is much more powerful if you're using Sentry's SDKs. It will leverage the error and traces they collect and render them locally.

**Are you using one of these frameworks? Check out these guides instead:**

## Overlay

Start by installing the `@spotlightjs/spotlight` package in your existing frontend application.


<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
  ```sh 
  npm add @spotlightjs/spotlight 
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
  ```sh 
  pnpm add @spotlightjs/spotlight
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
  ```sh 
  yarn add @spotlightjs/spotlight
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
We're loading Spotlight with production dependencies as the import is static, but the expectation is that it will be tree-shaken out by checking for a development environment.

If you're using a dynamic import, its possible you can simply list this in your `devDependencies` intead.
:::

Inject the Spotlight overlay into your application:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Dynamic Import">
  If your bundler supports it, its recommended to do a dynamic import to aid tree-shaking:

  ```js
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
    import('@spotlightjs/spotlight').then((Spotlight) =>
      Spotlight.init({ injectImmediately: true })
    );
  }
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Vite">
  ```js
  import * as Spotlight from '@spotlightjs/spotlight';

  // only load Spotlight in dev
  if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
    Spotlight.init();
  }
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Other Bundlers">
  ```js
  import * as Spotlight from '@spotlightjs/spotlight';

  // only load Spotlight in dev
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
    Spotlight.init();
  }
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
It's important that your check for the dev environment is actually tree-shaken away at production build time.
We recommend comparing your build bundle size before and after adding the Spotlight overlay.
:::

Upon loading your UI you should now see the Spotlight toolbar in bottom-right corner of your application.

For more options on how to configure Spotlight's UI, see [Configuration](/reference/configuration/).

:::tip
Spotlight will automatically configure [Sentry's Browser SDKs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/) to send data to the default Sidecar.

If you are using additional runtimes, such as [Node.js](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/node/), [PHP](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/php/), or [Python](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/), you should take a look at Sentry's SDKs on how to enable Spotlight. Generally this as easy as `spotlight: true` in `Sentry.init()`:


```js
Sentry.init({
  spotlight: true
})
```

## Sidecar

Spotlight's [architecture](/architecture/) requires a sidecar to be running alongside your service. This is to enable streaming data collection from your backend services into the Spotlight overlay.
