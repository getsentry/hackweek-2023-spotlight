description: A guide how to setup Spotlight in your environment

Spotlight can be used with a variety of frameworks and even in your custom environment. 

While it's not dependent on Sentry, Spotlight is much more powerful if you're using Sentry's SDKs. It will leverage the error and traces they collect and render them locally.

import { LinkCard, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<LinkCard title="Spotlight for Astro" description="Astro specific instructions for setting up Spotlight." href="/setup/astro/" />

## Overlay

You'll start by registering the Spotlight package in your existing frontend application.

Install the `@spotlightjs/overlay` package:

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
  ```sh 
  npm add @spotlightjs/overlay 
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
  ```sh 
  pnpm add @spotlightjs/overlay
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
  ```sh 
  yarn add @spotlightjs/overlay
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
We're loading Spotlight with production dependencies as the import is static, but the expectation is it will be tree-shaken out using the environment test.
:::

Inject Spotlight into your application:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Vite">
  ```js
  import * as Spotlight from '@spotlightjs/overlay';

  // only load Spotlight in dev
  if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
    Spotlight.init();
  }
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Other">
  ```js
  import * as Spotlight from '@spotlightjs/overlay';

  // only load Spotlight in dev
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
    Spotlight.init();
  }
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Upon loading your UI you should now see the Spotlight toolbar in bottom-right corner of your application.

For more options on how to configure Spotlight's UI, see [Configuration](/reference/configuration/).

:::tip
Spotlight will automatically configure [Sentry's Browser SDKs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/) to send data to the default Sidecar.

If you are using additional runtimes, such as [Node.js](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/node/), [PHP](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/php/), or [Python](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/), you should take a look at Sentry's SDKs on how to enable Spotlight. Generally this as easy as `spotlight: true` in `Sentry.init()`:


```js
Sentry.init({
  spotlight: true
})
```

## Sidecar

Spotlight's [architecture](/architecture/) requires a sidecar to be running alongside your service. This is to enable streaming data collection from your backend services into the Spotlight overlay.
