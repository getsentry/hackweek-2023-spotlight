title: Setup Spotlight Overlay directly in HTML
description: Use the overlay directly in HTML

To use Spotlight directly, you can load the script from a CDN and initialize it in a separate script tag.

This solution will probably change in the future, as we are working on a better way to load Spotlight.


```html {7, 10, 14-19}
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Spotlight</title>
    <!-- Set process for development environment -->
    <script>
      window.process = { env: { NODE_ENV: 'development' } };
    </script>
    <!-- Load Spotlight.js from the CDN -->
    <script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@spotlightjs/overlay@latest/dist/sentry-spotlight.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Import and initialize Spotlight in a separate script tag -->
    <script type="module">
      import * as Spotlight from 'https://unpkg.com/@spotlightjs/overlay@latest/dist/sentry-spotlight.js';
      Spotlight.init({
        openOnInit: true,
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
