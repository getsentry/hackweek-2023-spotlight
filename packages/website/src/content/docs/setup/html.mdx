To use Spotlight directly, you can load the script from a CDN and initialize it in a separate script tag.

## Configuration

```html {6}
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Spotlight</title>
    <!-- Load Spotlight.js from the CDN -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@spotlightjs/overlay@latest/dist/sentry-spotlight.iife.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    Your app
  </body>
</html>
```
