An integration in Spotlight is rather powerful. It can completely change the behavior, add, remove functionality from
Spotlight.

## Integration Ordering

All integrations are run in the order that they are configured. For instance, for the array `[sentry(), astro()]` in the
`init` call, `sentry()` will run before `astro()` and astro might overwrite things perviously configured.

Your integration should ideally be able to run in any order. If this isn’t possible, we recommend documenting that your integration
needs to come first or last in your user’s integrations configuration array.

## Explaining the Sentry Integration


_so you can write your own_

---

First the integration needs a name `name: 'sentry'`.

**Setup**

Next up, we have an optional function that is invoked during initialization of Spotlight called `setup`.
In Sentry's case we try to find a running Browser SDK and hook into it to tell it to send events to the Sidecar.

**How does an integration receive events?**

It receives an event depending on a list of compatible headers, e.g for Sentry Integration: `forwardedContentType: ['application/x-sentry-envelope']`.
So any event the Overlay receives from the Sidecar with the header `Content-Type: application/x-sentry-envelope` will be forwarded to the `Sentry` integration.

`processEvent` is the function the gets invoked on the integration for every incoming event matching the headers.

**Tabs**

An integration can return a function that returns an array of tabs, and also what panel/content Spotlight should render when the tab is selected.

```js
tabs: () => [
  {
    id: 'errors',
    title: 'Errors',
    notificationCount: sentryDataCache.getEvents().filter(e => !e.type).length,
    content: ErrorsTab,
  },
  {
    id: 'traces',
    title: 'Traces',
    notificationCount: sentryDataCache.getTraces().length,
    content: TracesTab,
  },
  {
    id: 'sdks',
    title: 'SDKs',
    content: SdksTab,
  },
],
```
:::caution
  The content must be a React component, and React should be imported from "@spotlightjs/spotlight".
  Ensure that the React instance is the same.
:::


`NotificationCount` is optional but can determine if Spotlight should update the number on the tab.
See [IntegrationTab interface](/reference/integrationtab) for more information.


And that's already it. This is just a very basic example, you can look at the code directly on Github so see all the details.

:::note

Keep in mind, Spotlight is still very early in development, the API is simple and might change in the future. Leave your feedback if you have ideas on what we could add/improve.
