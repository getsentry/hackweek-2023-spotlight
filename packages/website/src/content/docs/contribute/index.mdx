Spotlight relies on a [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) monorepo. You'll need to install pnpm to get things going, which can be done with [Volta](https://volta.sh).

Pull down the repo (or your fork):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/getsentry/spotlight.git
```

Ensure the node and pnpm are available:

```shell
volta install node pnpm
```

Lastly, install the package requirements:

```shell
pnpm install
```

## Development

From there you can spin up the Spotlight repo into watch mode:

```shell
pnpm dev:core
```

Depending on what you're doing there's two paths to develop against the core.

If you simply want to run Spotlight against the example application, you can spin that up using:

```shell
pnpm dev:playground
```

Additionally you may want to link it into an existing project. This is a little brittle, and we're not experts here, so your mileage may vary.

First, when in the Spotlight root directory, you'll need to link the packages you're referencing (likely `@spotlightjs/core` and `@spotlightjs/sidecar`):

```shell
pnpm link --global -C packages/core
pnpm link --global -C packages/sidecar
```

You can now link these within your project. For example if you're using `pnpm`:

```shell
pnpm link --global @spotlightjs/core
pnpm link --global @spotlightjs/sidecar
```

## Repository Structure

The monorepo is mostly straight forward, but here's a quick summary: 

```
spotlight
└── packages                
    ├── core         // @spotlightjs/core     - the main overlay
    ├── sidecar      // @spotlightjs/sidecar  - the sidecar (proxy) for streaming data
    ├── tsconfig     // @spotlightjs/tsconfig - shared tsconfig
    └── website      // @spotlightjs/website  - the main overlay
```
