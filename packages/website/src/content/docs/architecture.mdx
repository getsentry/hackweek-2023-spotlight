### Description

Spotlight consists of 2 main components. The UI that is embedded in your Website. 
And a Sidecar (Proxy) that streams incoming events to the UI.

You can send any kind of events to the Sidecar, it forwards it to Spotlight and the integrations within Spotlight need to understand what to do with it.

<LinkCard title="Sidecar" description="Understand what the sidecar does" href="/sidecar/" />

Spotlight by default has a Sentry integration, if you are using a Sentry SDK and enable the Spotlight connection (only required on the Server), Spotlight is able
to render Traces/Errors and more in your frontend.
