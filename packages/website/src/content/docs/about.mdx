Spotlight started out as a Hackweek project at Sentry:

> Spotlight is Sentry for Development. Inspired by an old project, Django Debug Toolbar, Spotlight brings a rich debug
overlay into development environments, and it does it by leveraging the existing power of Sentry's SDKs.

At a high level, Spotlight consists of two components:

1. An overlay (`@spotlightjs/overlay`) that renders inside of your application. The overlay is a simple React application, and can
   seamlessly run in any web application (or even independently!).

2. A proxy server (`@spotlightjs/sidecar`) which enables push-based communication to the overlay. This is achieved via a simple HTTP relay,
   allowing SDKs to push events to it, and allowing the overlay to receive events using [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events).

This means that adoption in most projects is two simple additions:

```shell
npm add @spotlightjs/overlay @spotlightjs/sidecar
```

Registering Spotlight in your frontend application:

```typescript
import * as Spotlight from '@spotlightjs/overlay';
Spotlight.init();
```

Running the sidecar in the background:

```shell
npx @spotlightjs/sidecar
```

The overlay itself behaves a little differently from Sentry. That's intentional both because this is for local
development, but also because the project is completely independent of Sentry (other than our guaranteed support).

Spotlight can show you errors, traces, configurations settings, installed dependencies, you name it. Spotlight is developed with customizablity in mind, so you can add your own integrations to it.
